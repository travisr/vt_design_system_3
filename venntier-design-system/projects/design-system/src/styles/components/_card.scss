// Card Component Overrides - MODERNIZED
// Most card styling is now handled by mat.card-overrides() in _core-refined.scss
// This file now only contains legacy compatibility and any future custom extensions

@mixin vt-card-theme() {
  // LEGACY COMPATIBILITY: This mixin is kept for backward compatibility
  // All card styling is now handled by the modern override approach in _core-refined.scss

  // The following styles are automatically applied via mat.card-overrides():
  // - Flat design (no elevation)
  // - 8px border radius
  // - Surface colors and typography
  // - Title and subtitle styling

  // The following styles are applied via custom CSS in _core-refined.scss:
  // - 32px padding
  // - Border styling and hover states
  // - Card sections, actions, footer spacing
  // - Image handling
  // - Card variants (compact, comfortable, borderless, interactive, selected)
  // - Layout helpers (grid, list)

  // This mixin is now essentially empty but maintained for compatibility.
  // Remove this file entirely once all imports are updated to use the new approach.
