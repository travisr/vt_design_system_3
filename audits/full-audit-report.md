- Remove deprecated patterns (::ng-deep, etc.)

### ⚠️ High Priority
- Replace custom styles with design tokens
- Move visual styling to design system
- Use layout utilities for demo components

## ⚡ Quick Wins

Automated fixes you can run now:
```bash
# Migrate to new control flow
ng generate @angular/core:control-flow

# Convert to standalone components
ng generate @angular/core:standalone

# Generate Material 3 theme

- [ ] Use theme overrides instead of CSS overrides
- [ ] Leverage Material elevation mixins
- [ ] Follow Material component guidelines

### Design System
- [ ] All colors from MD3 tokens
- [ ] All spacing from 8px grid tokens
- [ ] Demo styles for layout only
- [ ] Component customization in library, not demos
